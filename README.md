## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

### About myself:
I'm a Software engineer with an extensive business development background. Before expanding my lifelong programming hobby into a career through the Software Engineering program at Springboard, I managed corporate relationships and oversaw the creation of national point-of-sale marketing campaigns, the integration of vendor onboarding across Jet.com and Walmart e-Commerce, and, as an intern, relaunched the Help Desk section for one of Adobe's largest platforms.
