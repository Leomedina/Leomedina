# <div align="center">Hi! I'm Leo.</div>

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on Considered Collectively, a web app that allows people to follow current legislation in the United States Congress. You can see that [here!](https://considered-collectively.herokuapp.com/).

ðŸ›’ In addition to Considered Collectively, I've open-sourced a tool that allows JavaScript developers to more easily read and write to PostgreSQL databases. You can see that tool [here!](https://github.com/Leomedina/lightweight-pg-orm) I'm really interested in improving my projects, so if you have any feedback feel free to reach out :) 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open Source Projects and intitiatives to increase representation of minorites in tech.
