# <div align="center">Hi! I'm Leo</div>

I'm a software engineer with an extensive business development background. Before expanding my lifelong programming hobby into a career through the Software Engineering program at Springboard, I managed corporate relationships where I oversaw the creation of national point-of-sale marketing campaigns, the integration of vendor onboarding across Jet.com and Walmart e-Commerce, and, as an intern, relaunched the Help Desk section for one of Adobe's largest platforms.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently erolled in Springboard's Software Engineering program and working on Considered Collectively, a web app that allows people to follow current legislation in the United States Congress.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node and React.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open Source Projects and intitiatives to increase representation of minorites in tech. 

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him.
